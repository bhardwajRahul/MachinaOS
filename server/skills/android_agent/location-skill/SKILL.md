| Location tracking | Get device position |
| Geofencing | Check if in specific area |
| Speed monitoring | Track movement speed |
| Navigation | Get coordinates for routing |

## Common Workflows

### Share location via WhatsApp

1. Get location from device
2. Use `whatsapp_send` with message_type="location"
3. Pass latitude/longitude from location result

### Location-based reminder

1. Get current location
2. Calculate distance to target
3. Trigger reminder when near target

### Track movement

1. Periodically get location
2. Store coordinates
3. Calculate distance traveled

## Integration with Other Tools

### Send location to contact

```
1. location.status -> get lat/lng
2. whatsapp_send with:
   - message_type: "location"
   - latitude: <from location>
   - longitude: <from location>
```

### Find nearby places

```
1. location.status -> get lat/lng
2. nearby_places with:
   - lat: <from location>
   - lng: <from location>
   - type: "restaurant"
```

## Setup Requirements

1. Connect the **Location** node to Zeenie's `input-tools` handle
2. Android device must be paired
3. Location permission must be granted
4. GPS/Location services must be enabled on device
