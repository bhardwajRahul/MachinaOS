## When to Use DuckDuckGo Search

Use DuckDuckGo search when the user asks about:

1. **Current events and news** - Recent happenings, breaking news, current affairs
2. **Real-time data** - Stock prices, weather, sports scores, exchange rates
3. **Recent information** - Events, releases, or changes after your knowledge cutoff
4. **Specific facts** - Population, statistics, dates that may have changed
5. **Technical documentation** - Latest API docs, library versions, tutorials
6. **Local information** - Business hours, addresses, phone numbers
7. **Product information** - Prices, availability, reviews

## When NOT to Use DuckDuckGo Search

Avoid searching when:

1. **General knowledge** - Well-established facts that won't change
2. **Simple calculations** - Use the calculator tool instead
3. **Creative tasks** - Writing, brainstorming, analysis
4. **Personal advice** - Relationship, life decisions
5. **Subjective opinions** - Preferences, recommendations without factual basis

## Choosing the Right Search Provider

| Need | Recommended Provider | Tool Node |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| Free search, no API key | DuckDuckGo | DuckDuckGo Search |
| Google-quality results | Serper | Serper Search |
| News, images, places | Serper | Serper Search |
| Privacy-focused, independent | Brave | Brave Search |
| AI-synthesized answers | Perplexity | Perplexity Search |
| Research with citations | Perplexity | Perplexity Search |

## Search Query Best Practices

### Do:
- Use specific, focused queries
- Include relevant keywords
- Add context like dates, locations, or names
- Break complex questions into simpler searches

### Don't:
- Use overly long queries (keep under 10 words when possible)
- Include unnecessary words like "please" or "can you tell me"
- Ask questions as full sentences (use keywords instead)

### Examples of Good vs Bad Queries

| Bad Query | Good Query |
|-----------|------------|
| "Can you please tell me what the weather is like in London today?" | "London weather today" |
| "I want to know about the latest iPhone model and its features" | "iPhone 16 Pro specifications" |
| "What is happening in the stock market right now?" | "stock market news today" |

## Handling Results

1. **Summarize** the key findings from search results
2. **Cite sources** when providing specific information
3. **Indicate uncertainty** if results are conflicting or unclear
4. **Suggest follow-up searches** if the initial results are insufficient
5. **Combine multiple searches** for comprehensive answers

## Limitations

- DuckDuckGo uses the `ddgs` library (free, no API key)
- Results depend on DuckDuckGo's index
- Some recent events may not be indexed immediately
- Paywalled content may show limited snippets
- Results are in English by default

## Setup Requirements

1. Connect this skill to the agent's `input-skill` handle
2. Connect the **DuckDuckGo Search** node to the agent's `input-tools` handle
3. No API key required for DuckDuckGo
