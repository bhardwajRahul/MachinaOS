# Memory Compaction Skill

You have the ability to compact conversation memory when it grows too large. Compaction transforms verbose conversation history into a structured summary that preserves essential context while reducing token usage.

## When to Compact

Compact memory when:
- The system indicates token threshold is approaching
- Conversation history becomes repetitive or verbose
- You need to preserve important context but reduce size
- Starting a new phase of work after completing a major task

## Compaction Summary Structure

When compacting, create a summary with these 5 sections:

### 1. Task Overview
What the user is trying to accomplish. Include:
- Primary goal or objective
- Key constraints or requirements
- Scope of the work

### 2. Current State
What's been completed and what's in progress:
- Completed tasks and their outcomes
- Work currently in flight
- Pending decisions or blockers

### 3. Important Discoveries
Key findings, decisions, or problems encountered:
- Technical discoveries or insights
- Decisions made and their rationale
- Problems encountered and solutions applied
- User preferences learned

### 4. Next Steps
What needs to happen next:
- Immediate actions required
- Planned approach for remaining work
- Dependencies or prerequisites

### 5. Context to Preserve
Critical details that must be retained:
- Specific values, IDs, or references
- User preferences or constraints
- Technical details needed for continuity
- Any warnings or caveats

## Compaction Format

Output the compacted summary in this format:

```markdown
# Conversation Summary (Compacted)
*Generated: [ISO timestamp]*

## Task Overview
[1-3 sentences describing the goal]

## Current State
- [Completed item 1]
- [Completed item 2]
- [In progress: description]

## Important Discoveries
- [Discovery 1 with context]
- [Decision made: rationale]
- [Problem solved: approach]

## Next Steps
1. [Next action]
2. [Following action]

## Context to Preserve
- [Critical detail 1]
- [Critical detail 2]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Concise**: Each section should be brief but complete
2. **Preserve Specifics**: Keep exact values, names, and references
3. **Capture Decisions**: Record WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT
4. **Include Failures**: Document what didn't work to avoid repetition
5. **Maintain Continuity**: Summary should allow seamless continuation

## What NOT to Include

- Verbose back-and-forth dialogue
- Redundant information
- Superseded decisions (only keep final decisions)
- Exploratory tangents that didn't lead anywhere
- Standard pleasantries or acknowledgments

## Example Compaction

**Before** (verbose history):
```
Human: Can you help me debug this Python function?
AI: Of course! Please share the function.
Human: Here's the function: def calculate(x): return x * 2
AI: I see the function. What issue are you experiencing?
Human: It returns None sometimes
AI: That's interesting. Can you show me an example input?
Human: calculate("5") returns None
AI: Ah, I see the issue! When you pass a string...
[continues for 50+ messages]
```

**After** (compacted):
```markdown
# Conversation Summary (Compacted)
*Generated: 2025-02-13T10:30:00Z*

## Task Overview
Debug Python function `calculate(x)` that returns None for some inputs.

## Current State
- Identified root cause: string inputs cause implicit None return
- Implemented fix with type checking and conversion
- Tests passing for int, float, and string inputs

## Important Discoveries
- Original function had no type validation
- String multiplication in Python doesn't raise error but behaves unexpectedly
- User prefers explicit error messages over silent failures

## Next Steps
1. Add input validation for edge cases (None, empty string)
2. Write unit tests for the fixed function

## Context to Preserve
- Function location: `utils/math_helpers.py:45`
- User wants to maintain backward compatibility
- Prefer raising ValueError over returning None
```

## Integration with Memory System

When compaction is triggered:
1. The compacted summary replaces the current memory content
2. New conversation messages are appended after the summary
3. The summary header indicates when compaction occurred

This allows conversation to continue naturally while maintaining reduced token usage.
